# Simplab
Simplab helps students to perform their **physics textbook experiments virtually**.
It aims to give practical knowledge to students who don't have access to good laboratories in their school.
The idea also covers the current situation of **COVID-19** as Simplab can also be used by any school or university to provide a virtual physics lab to their students and teachers.

## What exactly Simplab is?
Simplab in simple words is simply a virtual platform to simulate physics experiments, which offers the following features-
- All simualtions has some initial setup like to perform `current and electricity` experiments, it has a battery, a voltmeter etc.
- All the component will be connected, no efforts needed to coonect anything.
- A student can change the parameters and select from over a wide range of variables.
- Run simulation, ofcourse!
- Teacher/instructor can check the progress of any student in real-time.
- It supports RTC, so the teacher/instructor could easily comunicates with their students through chat/voice.

## What problem does Simplab solve?
- Due to **COVID-19**, most schools and universities are shut, resulting in a lack of practical knowledge from lab experiments.
